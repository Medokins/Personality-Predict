# Personality-Predict

Algorithm based on (MBTI) Myers-Briggs Personality Type Dataset that predicts Your personality based on Your posts.

Currently I'm trying to balance Data because E _ _ _ (extroverts) group is only 10% or less of whole data (and should be around 50% to be balanced). PS I've got an idea to get around it and I'm currently working on it. In the end I want to crate individual algorithm for each letter and than merge all of them to predict full personlaity type
